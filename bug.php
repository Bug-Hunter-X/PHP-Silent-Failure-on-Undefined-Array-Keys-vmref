In PHP, a common yet often overlooked error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  When you attempt to access an array element using a non-existent key, PHP will not throw an error, but will return NULL. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues. For example:

```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$value = $myArray['c']; // $value will be NULL, no error is thrown
```

This silent failure can be especially problematic when the null value is used in subsequent calculations or comparisons, resulting in incorrect results without any obvious indication of the problem.
